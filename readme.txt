Scans your wp-content directory for vulnerable instances of timthumb.php, and optionally upgrades them to a safe version.

== Description ==

The recent Timthumb.php vulnerability (discussed [here](http://markmaunder.com/2011/08/02/technical-details-and-scripts-of-the-wordpress-timthumb-php-hack/)) has left scores of unsuspecting bloggers hacked. It's the perfect combination of not so easy to fix for the technically disinclined, and easy to find and exploit for the malicious - resulting in a disastrous number of compromised sites.

The Timthumb Vulnerability Scanner plugin will scan your entire wp-content directory for instances of any outdated and insecure version of the timthumb script, and give you the option to automatically upgrade them with a single click.  Doing so will protect you from hackers looking to exploit this particular vulnerability.

After new, lesser vulnerabilities were found, it became apparent that the plugin needs to be dynamic - able to keep you up to date with the latest version of timthumb, without requiring a plugin upgrade.  The plugin now checks for the latest available version of timthumb routinely (each time you visit the scanner page, but no more than once a day), and can download and install the latest version, rather than the one included with the plugin.

Special thanks to [Jacob Gillespie](http://jacobwg.com/) for help with the bulk upgrade feature.
== Installation ==

1. Upload the `timthumb-vulnerability-scanner to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (alternatively, you could use the backend WordPress plugin installer, or install directly from the repository)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Visit the "Timthumb Scanner" page under the "Tools" Menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this look for specifically? =

The scanner checks for all instances of timthumb it can find.  It doesn't just check filename - it looks for code inside the file, ensuring that regardless of what a theme or plugin developer has named the file, it will be caught.

= Where does it look for them? =

The entire wp-content directory (even if it's not called wp-content) is scanned, including plugins, themes, and uploads.

= I think I've already been hacked - will this clean it up? =

No.  This plugin exists to make sure your door is locked, not drag the burglers out of your house.  It will run some cursory checks to see if a hacker has likely already hit your site, but has no functionality to clean up the problem.

If you've already been hacked, all is not lost - there are people out there who will clean up your site for a fee.  Get in touch here: http://codegarage.com/hack-cleanup
